Allows to exchange and share post links + thumbnails across Wordpress blogs, based on matching tags and categories.
== Description ==

A widget that permits blogmasters to share and exchange links to their posts based on common taxonomy, across their blogs (ie. posts having the same tags or categories). Each link is automatically associated to a thumbnail image.

= Share your posts! =

This Wordpress plugin installs a **new sidebar widget** that can display **links to relevant posts on other Wordpress blogs** with **automatic thumbnail images**.
The links are chosen based on common language and taxonomy (ie posts in the same language having the same tag(s) or category).
The plugin uses **cache** to avoid multiple database and RSS query.
It has its own widget control pannel.
The look & feel of the post2peer widget is very close to its cousin, the [YD Recent Posts Widget](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/yd-recent-posts-widget/).

Please visit the [YD Post2Peer Widget plugin support site](http://www.yann.com/wp-plugins/post2peer-wordpress-plugin "Yann Dubois' Post2Peer Widget for Wordpress")
 and the [Post2Peer.com open posts directory](http://post2peer.com/about "Post2Peer posts and sites directory") to get more info on the Post2Peer project and what's it's all about.

= Why share you posts? =

By using this plugin, you will automagically allow all your posts to be registered in the Post2Peer database (this uses you regular Wordpress rss feed, plus a special crawler to generate thumbnails for every post).
Once your posts are in the database, they will be elligible to be displayed as links on other person's blogs (those using the plugin).
Because the link selection algorithm is based on you posts' taxonomy (tags and categories), links to your posts get to be displayed in a relevant context.
This should draw new visitors to your site and improve your SEO.
The inclusion in the directory is an added bonus, immediately generating deep backlinks to your site's posts.

= Why display links to other's blog posts? =

By enabling the Post2Peer plugin, you are able to present you site's visitor with up-to-date, real-time info relevant to the subject the visitor is currently browsing.
The links you display will very probably complement the info in your own post, so it is a way to position your site as a comprehensive reference on the given subject.
The Post2Peer widget is like an enhanced RSS widget that will display relevant content agregated from a wide database of other Wordpress blogs that publish similarly focused features.
The fact that the content is always presented in a visual way (with a small thumbnail image next to each link) adds to the visual attractiveness of your page.

= It's fun! =

Based on a peer-to-peer concept, the whole process will increase in quality and eventually grow to a wide community of bloggers supporting each other by automatically exchanging relevant links to posts across blogs.
Even in the early stage of its deployment, this plugin is fun because it may link blog posts together in a way that you would never have expected.

Use comments.

I will answer only on that page so that all users can benefit from the answer. 
So please come back to see the answer or subscribe to that page's post comments.

= Why do I see irrelevant or seemingly random posts showing up? =

The [post2peer.com](http://post2peer.com/) directory will try its best to find posts that match your taxonomy.
However, if there is no relevant content available, it will fall back to a wider selection in order to allow your widget to display the specified "minimum number of links".
This can lead to random or otherwise irrelevant topics showing up.
To avoid this fallback system, please specify a "minimum number of links" of 0 in the widget's control pannel.
A good way to find more relevant or related links, is to improve the "matching factor" by adding popular tags to your posts.
